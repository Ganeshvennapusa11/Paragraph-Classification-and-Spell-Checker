 This project presents a user-friendly application for finding and 
correcting the spelling mistakes and categorizing those paragraphs into categories 
that are already defined. This tool uses a dictionary-based approach, the 
misspelled word will be corrected by first nearest word from the pre-defined 
dictionary, it will also give autosuggestions for the misspelled words with the 
first three nearest words from the dictionary. It will analyse the content and 
categorize the certain paragraph to classify it into their respective domains such 
as finance, technology, sports, history, science, or politics. It is also implemented 
using Python and Tkinter, it provides a user-friendly and interactive GUI 
(Graphical User Interface) for efficient text processing.
